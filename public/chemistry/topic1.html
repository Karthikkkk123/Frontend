    <h1>Introduction to Atomic Structure</h1>
    <p>This is the first topic in Chemistry, covering the fundamental concepts of atomic structure. We will explore the history of the atomic model, including the contributions of scientists like Dalton, Thomson, Rutherford, and Bohr.</p>
    <p>The atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. It is composed of a central nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus.</p>
