  <h1>Topic 2: Electromagnetism</h1>
  <p>Electromagnetism is the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles.</p>
  
  <h2>Maxwell's Equations</h2>
  <p>These are a set of four fundamental equations that form the foundation of classical electromagnetism.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Gauss's Law for Electricity</li>
      <li>Gauss's Law for Magnetism</li>
      <li>Faraday's Law of Induction</li>
      <li>Ampere's Law with Maxwell's addition</li>
  </ul>
