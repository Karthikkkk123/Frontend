  <h1>Topic 1: Newtonian Mechanics</h1>
  <p>Newtonian mechanics is a pillar of classical physics. It describes the motion of bodies under the influence of forces.</p>
  <h2>Newton's Laws of Motion</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Law of Inertia:</b> An object remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by a force.</li>
    <li><b>Law of Acceleration:</b> The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F=ma).</li>
    <li><b>Law of Action-Reaction:</b> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This is a simple table:</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Concept</th><th>Formula</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Momentum (p)</td><td>p = mv</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kinetic Energy (K)</td><td>K = 1/2 mv<sup>2</sup></td></tr>
  </table>
